# AWS MQTT Demo

This demo application connects to **AWS MQTT broker** using TLS with mutual authentication between the client and the server.
It demonstrates the subscribe-publish workflow of MQTT.

Visit [*coreMQTT Demo (Mutual Authentication)*](https://www.freertos.org/Documentation/03-Libraries/03-FreeRTOS-core/02-coreMQTT/02-Demos/03-Mutual-authentication) for further information. 
Please note, that [*properly configured thing*](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-moisture-create-thing.html) is required to
successfully run the demo application.

## Requirements

- [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/free) to connect a [*AWS IoT Thing*](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-moisture-create-thing.html).
- A CMSIS-Toolbox enabled toolchain such as [Keil Studio for VS Code](https://www.keil.arm.com/). The [MDK Community Edition](https://www.keil.arm.com/keil-mdk/#mdk-v6-editions) provides all tools required for evaluation.

## Project Structure

This AWS MQTT Mutual Authentication example uses the [CMSIS-Toolbox](https://open-cmsis-pack.github.io/cmsis-toolbox/)
*csolution project format* with CMSIS software packs and software layers. The default configuration uses a AVH-FVP simulation model.
No physical hardware is required to explore this example. By using different layers it can run on physical evaluation boards,
use different communication stacks, or WiFi modules.

:----------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------
[`Demo.csolution.yml`](Demo.csolution.yml)                                   | Specifies the target hardware, build types, and defines the actual software layers used.
[`Demo.cproject.yml`](Demo.cproject.yml)                                     | Contains the source files and components that belong to user application.
[`Socket/.../Socket.clayer.yml`](Socket/VSocket/Socket.clayer.yml)           | Contains the source files and components of the communication interface.
[`Board/.../Board.clayer.yml`](Board/AVH_MPS3_Corstone-300/Board.clayer.yml) | Contains the hardware interfaces to the device and board peripherals.
`Shield/.../Shield.clayer.yml`                                               | Contains the interface source files to an optional Arduino WiFi Shield.

## Configure AWS IoT Thing

To run the demo application [*configure the AWS IoT Thing*](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-moisture-create-thing.html) with these steps:

- Modify the following definitions in [FreeRTOS-Plus/Demo/Config/demo_config.h](FreeRTOS-Plus/Demo/Config/demo_config.h):
  - `democonfigCLIENT_IDENTIFIER`: Thing Name (AWS IoT->Manage->Things->Name in AWS IoT console)
  - `democonfigMQTT_BROKER_ENDPOINT`: Remote Host Address (AWS IoT->Settings in AWS IoT console)
  - `democonfigROOT_CA_PEM`: Server's root CA Certificate
  - `democonfigCLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PEM`: Client Certificate
  - `democonfigCLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY_PEM`: Client Private Key

## Run on AVH FVP Simulation Model

Once the *AWS IoT Thing* is configured it can be build and run on AVH FVP simulation models.

```bash
cbuild Demo.csolution.yml --context .Debug+AVH --packs
FVP_Corstone_SSE-300 -f Board/AVH_MPS3_Corstone-300/fvp_config.txt out/Demo/AVH/Debug/Demo.axf -Q 10
```

The execution on AVH FVP simulation models should create this output:

```txt

```

The MQTT messages can be viewed in the [**AWS IoT console**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/view-mqtt-messages.html).

## [Contiguous Integration (CI)](https://github.com/Arm-Examples/AWS_MQTT_Demo/tree/main/.doc/README.md)
The [README.md](https://github.com/Arm-Examples/AWS_MQTT_Demo/tree/main/.doc/README.md) in the [`.doc`](https://github.com/Arm-Examples/AWS_MQTT_Demo/tree/main/.doc) folder describes the [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/Arm-Examples/AWS_MQTT_Demo/tree/main/.github/workflows) for build and execution tests. It executes similar steps on a GitHub Runner.

## Configure for Evaluation Boards

The **AWS MQTT Demo** can be deployed to physical evaluation boards using these steps:

- The [`pack: MDK-Packs::IoT_Socket`](https://www.keil.arm.com/packs/iot_socket-mdk-packs) is the interface to the [communication stack](https://mdk-packs.github.io/IoT_Socket/latest/iot_socket_using.html#iot_socket_select).
- Select a Board that offers suitable board layer. Several [Board Support Packs for ST Boards](https://www.keil.arm.com/boards/?q=&vendor=stmicroelectronics) contain a suitable board layer for this MQTT example. The pack overview lists the [Provided API Interfaces](https://www.keil.arm.com/packs/nucleo-f756zg_bsp-keil). The IoT Socket interface requires for Ethernet `CMSIS_ETH`, for WiFi `ARDUINO_UNO_I2C` or `ARDUINO_UNO_UART`.
- The [`pack: ARM::CMSIS-Driver`](https://www.keil.arm.com/packs/cmsis-driver-arm) provides the layers for various [WiFi modules](https://arm-software.github.io/CMSIS-Driver/latest/shield_layer.html#shield_WiFi). These connect to boards that provide Arduino connectors.

Depending on the selected hardware, the file [`Demo.csolution.yml`](Demo.csolution.yml) is configured.  Below the configuration for `NUCLEO-F756ZG` is shown.

```yml
   packs:
    - pack: ARM::V2M_MPS3_SSE_300_BSP@1.5.0
    - pack: Keil::NUCLEO-F756ZG_BSP@2.0.0       # Add BSP
    - pack: ARM::CMSIS-Driver@2.10.0            # Add CMSIS-Driver for WiFi Shields

  target-types:
    - type: AVH
      board: ARM::V2M-MPS3-SSE-300-FVP
        :

    - type: MyBoard
      board: NUCLEO-F756ZG                      # Add board name
```

### Using [Keil Studio for VS Code](https://www.keil.arm.com/)

Once, the file [`Demo.csolution.yml`](Demo.csolution.yml) is configured, use the **Manage Solution** view and change the **Active Target**.

![Select Context Set](.doc/ContextSet.png)

The IDE will evaluate the compatible software layers and shows the **Configure Solution** view. Depending on the board several options can be selected.  Click **OK** to choose a selection.

![Add Software Layer](.doc/AddSoftwareLayer.png)

This completes the setup and the file [`Demo.csolution.yml`](Demo.csolution.yml) now contains the settings for the layers.

```yml
  target-types:
    - type: AVH
      board: ARM::V2M-MPS3-SSE-300-FVP
        :
    - type: MyBoard
      board: NUCLEO-F756ZG
      variables:
        - Board-Layer: $SolutionDir()$/Board/NUCLEO-F756ZG/Board.clayer.yml
        - Shield-Layer: $SolutionDir()$/Shield/WiFi/Sparkfun_DA16200/Shield.clayer.yml
        - Socket-Layer: $SolutionDir()$/Socket/WiFi/Socket.clayer.yml
```

Use **Build solution** to translate the application.

### Manual Configuration

Refer to [CMSIS-Toolbox - Reference Applications - Usage](https://open-cmsis-pack.github.io/cmsis-toolbox/ReferenceApplications/#usage) for use command line tools to obtain above information.  However you may also use the CMSIS-Toolbox command `csolution list layers` to obtain information about the layers that are available in the installed packs.  These layers may be copied to your project directory and defined as shown above.

```bash
csolution list layers
.../Arm/Packs/ARM/CMSIS-Driver/2.10.0/Shield/WiFi/Inventek_ISMART43362-E/Shield.clayer.yml (layer type: Shield)
.../Arm/Packs/ARM/CMSIS-Driver/2.10.0/Shield/WiFi/Sparkfun_DA16200/Shield.clayer.yml (layer type: Shield)
.../Arm/Packs/ARM/CMSIS-Driver/2.10.0/Shield/WiFi/Sparkfun_ESP8266/Shield.clayer.yml (layer type: Shield)
.../Arm/Packs/ARM/CMSIS-Driver/2.10.0/Shield/WiFi/WizNet_WizFi360-EVB/Shield.clayer.yml (layer type: Shield)
.../Arm/Packs/Keil/NUCLEO-F756ZG_BSP/2.0.0/Layers/Default/Board.clayer.yml (layer type: Board)
.../Arm/Packs/MDK-Packs/IoT_Socket/1.4.0/layer/FreeRTOS_Plus_TCP/Socket.clayer.yml (layer type: Socket)
.../Arm/Packs/MDK-Packs/IoT_Socket/1.4.0/layer/MDK_Network_ETH/Socket.clayer.yml (layer type: Socket)
.../Arm/Packs/MDK-Packs/IoT_Socket/1.4.0/layer/VSocket/Socket.clayer.yml (layer type: Socket)
.../Arm/Packs/MDK-Packs/IoT_Socket/1.4.0/layer/WiFi/Socket.clayer.yml (layer type: Socket)
```

Use **cbuild** to translate the application.

```bash
cbuild Demo.csolution.yml --context .Debug+MyBoard --packs
```

## Build and Run

Once the application is translated use:

- A programmer or debugger to download the application.
- Run the application and view messages in a debug printf or terminal window.
